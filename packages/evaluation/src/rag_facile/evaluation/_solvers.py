def _call_pipeline(question: str) -> tuple[str, list[str]]:
    """Call the RAG pipeline and return formatted context + individual chunk texts.

    Uses :meth:`~rag_facile.pipelines.RAGPipeline.retrieve_chunks` to fetch
    chunks in a single Albert API call, then formats them locally via
    :func:`~rag_facile.context.format_context`.  This avoids the double-search
    that would result from calling ``process_query`` (search + rerank + format)
    and then re-running the search separately to extract chunk texts.

    ``BasicPipeline.retrieve_chunks`` returns ``[]``, so pipelines without
    chunk-level retrieval produce an empty chunk list — retrieval metrics will
    be vacuously true, which is the correct behaviour (no chunks to measure).

    Returns:
        tuple of (formatted_context, list_of_chunk_texts)

        - formatted_context: citation-annotated string for injection into the
          LLM prompt (identical output to ``process_query``).
        - list_of_chunk_texts: individual passage texts stored in
          ``state.metadata["retrieved_contexts"]`` for the ``context_recall``
          and ``context_precision`` scorers.

    Extracted as a module-level helper so tests can patch it cleanly.

    Calls :meth:`~rag_facile.pipelines.RAGPipeline.retrieve_chunks` using the

    formatted and injected as a prefix to the user message.

    Two metadata keys are written for the scorers:

    - ``retrieved_contexts``: list[str] — individual chunk texts after
      search + rerank.  Used by ``context_recall`` and ``context_precision``
      (token-F1 comparison against ``relevant_contexts`` from the dataset).
    - The dataset's ``relevant_contexts`` are left untouched so scorers can
      compare retrieved vs relevant.

    If the pipeline returns no chunks (no collections configured, or no
    relevant chunks found), the dataset's pre-computed values are kept and the
    prompt is passed through unchanged.
